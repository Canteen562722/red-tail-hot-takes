# Red Tail's Hot Takes 
* Basketball is a joke sport anymore. Winter Olympics matters more because of hockey.
* Spooky season is all year long
* Which is why we need term limits for those asshats (supreme court)
* Employing a one Daniel Grimm is the dumbest thing someone could do
* brutal doom is meh even in vr
* both Fable and Gaylo are overrated slop.
* Halo damn near ruined the entire fps genre with its bullshit
* Halo and fable are dumpster fires
* One of the many reasons I didn't get an iPhone. Too many issues of software glitching.
